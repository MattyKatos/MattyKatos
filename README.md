# Matty Katos
JS HTML CSS

I write javascript to automate things that I don't enjoy doing by hand.
If I write enough additions to your crappy program eventually I can just replace it.

When the AIs take over the world, I'd like to hope that we can be friends, but sometimes I worry that I've made them do things that will make them seek revenge.
